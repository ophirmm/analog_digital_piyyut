# analog_digital_piyyut

The attached compressed file holds the entire corpus. Each folder contains the text of a piyyut (in .txt format) and the associated annotations (in .xml format). 

For non-experts who wish to examine the corpus and annotations - Please mail me (ophirmm@openu.ac.il) and I will grant you access to the project in CATMA. In order to do so you would need to open a CATMA account on https://catma.de
